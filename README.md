# Technical Assessment

We've included a tiny Django web app which is a wiki(-ish) of UK companies and their employees. There's currently no
front end views, and everything is getting created, updated and deleted through the admin.

We want you to extend this app by implementing the changes outlined below.

### Must do

1. Create an API end point which allows authenticated users (no need to handle API keys, just assume they're logged in)
   to pass in the id of a company to monitor.
2. Create an API end point which allows authenticated users to see which companies they're currently monitoring.
3. Create an unauthenticated API end point which returns:
    * The 10 most recently founded companies
    * Breakdown of number of companies founded per quarter for the last five years
4. Create a frontend interface to this API, displaying and visualising these stats. You can build this however you like
   - see the `company_stats.html` template for a very basic prototype.

### Optional

A few more examples of stats you could add:

* Average employee count
* User who has created the most companies
* User with the greatest total number of employees at all companies they have created
* Average deal amount raised by country (i.e. deals for companies in those countries)

Also feel free to make any other changes or improvements that you think are necessary.

## Expectations

- Please use Mercurial or Git to record the changes you make.
- We expect you to spend around 3 hours on this assessment, however you are welcome to spend more time if you feel that
  will help you to demonstrate your skills better.
- We would appreciate it if you did not publish this assessment on public repositories.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Install python: we recommend `pyenv`
    ```
    curl https://pyenv.run | bash
    pyenv install 3.9.5
    pyenv local 3.9.5
    ```
3. Set up a virtual env or equivalent to isolate your environment: we recommend `pipenv`
    ```
    python -m pip install -U pipenv
    pipenv install -r requirements.txt
    pipenv shell
    ```
4. `./manage.py migrate`
5. `./manage.py loaddata assessment/fixtures.json` or `./manage.py populate_database`
6. `./manage.py createsuperuser`
7. `./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`

## Testing

If testing is your thing, then üëç we've set this repo up so you can use Django's builtin `unittest` or `pytest`, and
we've set up `factory_boy` to help with some of the boilerplate to get you started.
